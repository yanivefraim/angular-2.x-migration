# angular1 + Typescript + ES6 modules + jspm + gulp

Don't panic - not yet another Angular seed project.

This is just a sandpit for me primarily. I wanted to start a new Angular 1.* project using typescript and ES6 modules - and after much faffing around settled on jspm and gulp for the build process. 

There are not a lot of examples yet of this combination, so putting here in case it is of use to anyone else.

Clone the repo and then:

npm install

jspm install

gulp

or to bundle

gulp deploy 

(bundled version goes to build/production folder)
